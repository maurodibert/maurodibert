In fact, my name is Mauro, but everyone calls me Mau. I have three years of experience as a professional developer, now <b>devoted to Dart and Flutter!</b>.

I have loved computers since I'm 5, exploring the first 3dStudio versions since 10, and designing with Illustrator and Photoshop as a side job hobby from 12. Nevertheless, life took me to another path, and I become a professional musician and opera singer.

I sang in Argentina and Latin America's major theaters for the most renowned conductors, produced successful albums and events when younger, and even started writing books as my last new side interest.

Before Coding as a profession, <b>I was an Opera Singer from the Teatro Colón of Buenos Aires till I accepted the love I have for creation and technology</b> and decided to make a huge career change. It took me a lot of Self-taught hours, Russian/German discipline cultivated during my previous career, and studying under the bridge to bring me where I am now: working full time for a Software Factory and every day becoming more passionate about coding.

If I have to select one thing <b>I can't live without is learning</b>. I love to learn. And teach. So <b>my focus is to specialize, learn from the best people I can reach, create the things I love, and help others do the same</b>. ❤️
